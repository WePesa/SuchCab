##Such.cab

A bidding and contracting platform for arranging pedicab rides. 

### The Goal
This project aims to create a marketplace for pedicabs. It aims to be an automatic dispatch system as well as a platform for arranging rides ahead of time, such as tours and special events requiring multiple cabs and special arrangements.

#### Why use a blockchain?
We want to provide a public transaction history to our users while keeping user-privacy intact. One-time addresses are used in each transaction to keep users identity secret. An ethereum contract keeps track of live-bids and offers.

#### Not just another ride-sharing app?

Not exactly. As stated, you can request a ride on the spot like other ride services, or schedule one in advance. You may request a specific number of vehicles. Before confirming the arrangement, you may communicate with the driver to work out any special details and discuss price.
Drivers have the ability to post various offers, for example "Available for hire in __ until __ o'clock for $__/hr" or "Tour the town for approx 30 min for $50"

#### Why Pedicabs?

Pedicab drivers can do very well when they stay busy. But busy days dont usually fill the calendar so its important for pedicab companies to sell tours, get paid for special events, pre-arranged charters and promotional campaigns,

Such.cab will provide any driver with an online storefront with a set of offerings from pre-arranged hourly rates, tours, parties, daily rental, etc
This is an advantage to the driver whose revenue is mostly in-person sales and paid special events, arranged by their company.

#### Who is going to use this?

Our target customers are: 
- pedicabbers, looking to set their own rates and increase their daily business by scheduling rides and tours ahead of time,
- pedicab companies, who want to more frequently sell multi-cab deals for special events
- businesses looking for a way to advertise themselves (hire for promotional rides)
- people who want to order a pedicab. Currently there is no app for that.
- people and businesses putting together events that require pedicab(s). Weddings or conferences for example

### Intended technology
 Such.cab will be  built on ethereum, node.js and clojurescript, with hopes of creating an electron app eventually.

### Looking for help!
 This project could use another node developer, someone familiar with solidity and running ethereum, and a designer! Get in touch!
